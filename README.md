# About RBXL-26
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb3e860-345c-4e33-a16b-d0495b4338e3)

This is a project made by **Azel**, in an attempt of giving life to the Roblox.com website, RBXL-26 is a setback to those times where there was actual creativity on roblox.

Message from the creator: 

"Sup fellas, it’s the man himself! Just a heads-up: this is the first extension I’ve ever made, and I built it mostly for fun because I hate boring themes. I don’t plan to actively update or maintain this project,if i update it, it's because i felt like it, so please don’t expect regular updates. Use it as-is, enjoy it, and have fun!"
