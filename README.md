# About RBXL-26
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb3e860-345c-4e33-a16b-d0495b4338e3)

This is a project made by **Azel**, in an attempt of giving life to the Roblox.com website, RBXL-26 is a setback to those times where there was actual creativity on roblox.

Message from the creator: 

"Sup fellas, it's the man himself, i want to remind you that this is the first extension i ever make, if you're going to leave criticism, please leave constructive criticism, that way,i can improve as a developer myself. However, i don't really plan to continue a lot with this project, i just made it for fun, and because i hate boring themes... But yeah, i hope you like this!!"
